This plugin sets options/variables according to the syntax under the 
cursor. It was originally created in response to 
http://groups.google.com/group/vim_use/browse_frm/thread/ff624d5a68f0a562 
and to solve a similar problem. While this plugin solves that other 
related problem it doesn't seem to work properly for tex files.

Configuration:

g:setsyntax_options            (default: {})
    This variable is a dictionary of dictionaries of dictionaries.
    {FILETYPE => {SYNREGEXP => {OPTION/VARIABLE: VALUE}}}
    
    Example:
      let g:setsyntax_options['tex'] = {'^texMathZone': {'&l:tw': 0}}


:SetSyntax SYNTAX,... VAR VALUE ...
:SetSyntax /REGEXP/ VAR VALUE ...
    Set syntax-specific options for the current buffer. When using a 
    REGEXP, the syntax names have to be already defined, i.e. you can use 
    the REGEXP only after the syntax file was loaded.
    
    VAR must be a variable name (see |:let| and |:let-&| for details). 
    I.e., if you want to set a option, e.g. spelllang, don't use

        SetSyntax /^texMath/ spelllang ""

    but instead use:

      SetSyntax /^texMath/ &l:spelllang ""
    
    VALUE actually is an expression that will be evaluated when setting 
    the variable.
    
    NOTE: Blanks in VALUE must be escaped with a backslash. See the help 
    page on <f-args> for details.
